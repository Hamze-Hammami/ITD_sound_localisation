## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a **sound localization robot** that estimates the azimuth (bearing) of a sound source and navigates toward it. The system is based on **Interaural Time Difference (ITD)** calculations and is designed to work with minimal hardware requirements.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an efficient and cost-effective **sound localization algorithm** that can be implemented on different robotic platforms using only two microphones.

## How It Works
1. **Listening Mode**: The robot waits for a sound signal and determines its general direction based on which microphone receives the sound first.
2. **Locating Mode**: Uses the ITD formula to estimate the precise angle of the sound source.
3. **Moving Mode**: The robot moves towards the estimated location, stopping when the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle.

## Hardware
EMoRo Robot:
- **EMoRo 2560 Board**
- **KY-038 Sound Sensors (x2)**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**
- **LCD Display**
- **Servo Motors for movement**

The robot determines the azimuth angle (Î¸) of a sound source using Interaural Time Difference (ITD). Woodworth's ITD formula is given as:

$$
ITD = \\frac{r (\\theta + \\sin \\theta)}{c}
$$

where:
- $ITD$ = Interaural Time Difference (time difference between sound reaching the left and right microphones)
- $r$ = Radius between microphones (in meters)
- $c$ = Speed of sound (343 m/s)
- $\\theta$ = Bearing (azimuth angle)

To calculate $\\theta$:

$$
\\theta + \\sin \\theta = \\frac{ITD \\times c}{r}
$$

By solving this equation, we estimate the direction of the sound source. The robot then turns toward this direction and refines its movement using additional ITD calculations.
